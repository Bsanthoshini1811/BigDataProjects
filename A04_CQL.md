## Objective:
In this assignment, we aim to design a Cassandra schema for an e-commerce platform by translating the existing relational database management system (RDBMS) schema using Query-First Approach. The objective is to leverage Cassandra's scalability and fault-tolerance for big data applications.The scope of translating the schema involves a comprehensive process focused on designing an optimized data model custom tailored for the specific querying patterns(query-first) and access requirements of the application.This involves analyzing the existing RDBMS schema to understand its structure and relationships, identifying common queries and access patterns used by the application, and designing the Cassandra schema accordingly. Key aspects include defining partition keys, clustering columns, and replication strategies to ensure efficient data distribution, query execution, and data availability. Additionally, determining the need for secondary indexes, partitioning strategies, and replication factors is essential for optimizing query performance and achieving fault tolerance. In summary, the scope encompasses a exhaustive approach to schema translation, focused on leveraging Cassandra's distributed architecture and NoSQL capabilities to meet the application's data management needs efficiently.

Converting an RDBMS schema to a Cassandra schema involves several considerations and benefits, particularly in the context of building an e-commerce application. Let's delve into the details of why this conversion is useful in many ways: 

1. **Scalability:** Cassandra is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it can handle large amounts of data by distributing it across multiple nodes in a cluster. Unlike traditional RDBMS, which can face scalability limitations, Cassandra can easily accommodate the growing data needs of an e-commerce application as the user base expands.
2. **Fault-tolerance:** Cassandra's distributed architecture ensures fault-tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes. This means that even if some nodes fail, the system remains operational, providing high availability because of the replication of these keyvalues in the other nodes. In contrast, a single-point-of-failure scenario is more common in traditional RDBMS setups (MySQL, Postgresql etc.) this means having backup plans in place to keep operations running smoothly even if there are unexpected issues like server failures or internet problems. By having redundancy and backup systems, businesses can ensure that customers can still make purchases and access services without disruptions, protecting their revenue and reputation.
3. **Performance:** Cassandra's decentralized architecture allows for distributed data storage and parallel processing of queries, leading to improved performance for read and write operations. This is crucial for an e-commerce application where fast response times are essential for providing a seamless user experience.
4. **Flexible Data Model:** Cassandra's data model, based on wide-column stores, offers more flexibility compared to the rigid schema of RDBMS. This allows developers to denormalize data and optimize it for specific query patterns, resulting in more efficient data retrieval. In an e-commerce context, where there are various types of queries related to products, users, orders, and inventory, this flexibility is advantageous.
5. **Schema Design for Query Optimization:** By adopting a "Query First" approach, developers can design the Cassandra schema based on the application's specific query requirements. This ensures that the schema is optimized for the most frequently executed queries, resulting in better performance and resource utilization.
6. **Cost-effectiveness:** Cassandra's open-source nature and ability to run on commodity hardware make it a cost-effective solution for deploying large-scale applications. The lower infrastructure costs combined with its scalability make it an attractive option for e-commerce businesses looking to manage their growing data volumes efficiently.
7. **Resilience to Data Spikes:** E-commerce applications often experience spikes in traffic during peak shopping seasons or promotional events. Cassandra's ability to handle sudden increases in data volume and request rates without sacrificing performance ensures that the application remains responsive even during peak times.

In summary, converting an RDBMS schema to a Cassandra schema for an e-commerce application offers several advantages, including scalability, fault-tolerance, performance improvements, flexible data modeling, optimized schema design, cost-effectiveness, and resilience to data spikes. These benefits collectively contribute to enhancing the overall performance, availability, and resilience of the e-commerce platform, ultimately providing a better experience for users.

## 3. Analyze the RDBMS Schema.

**E-Commerce RDBMS Schema.**

* **User Entity:** This entity represents the users. It stores information such as user ID, username, email, address, phone number, payment methods, and order history.
* **Product Entity:** This entity contains details about the products available for purchase. It includes attributes like product ID, name, description, price, category, brand, quantity available, images, and ratings/reviews.
* **Order Entity:** The order entity tracks the details of each user's orders. It includes information such as order ID, user ID (references users), order date, delivery address, total price, payment method, order status, and items purchased.
* **Shipping Entity:** This entity manages the shipping process for orders. It tracks details like shipping ID, order ID (references orders), shipping method, shipping address, shipping cost, tracking number, estimated delivery date, and shipping status.
* **Payment Entity:** The payment entity handles transactions made by users for their orders. It stores data such as payment ID, user ID (references users), order ID (references orders), payment date, payment method, payment amount, and payment status.
* **Inventory Entity:** This entity keeps track of the available inventory of products. It includes attributes like product ID (linked to the product entity), quantity available, quantity sold, reorder level, supplier ID (references to suppliers), last restocked date, unit cost, and location.
* **Supplier Entity:** The supplier entity stores information about the suppliers providing products to the e-commerce platform. It includes details such as supplier ID, supplier name, contact person, email, phone number, and address.

**Relationships:**

- Users place orders ("places") and make payments ("performs"). Users initiate transactions by placing orders and completing payments, driving the system's revenue flow.
- Orders contain products ("contains"). Orders serve as containers for selected products, organizing purchase details for efficient processing and fulfillment.
- Orders are associated with shipping details ("is shipped in"). Shipping details are linked to orders for delivery coordination, ensuring timely receipt of purchased items.
- Orders are paid for with payments ("is paid by"). Payments are linked to orders for transaction completion, securing the exchange of goods and services.
- Products are tracked in inventory ("tracked in"). Inventory manages and monitors product availability and stock levels, facilitating efficient supply chain management.
- Inventory items are supplied by suppliers ("supplied by"). Suppliers provide inventory items for sale within the system, ensuring a consistent product offering and availability.

**Assumptions:**

- Each order can have only one shipping and payment entry.
- Products can be associated with multiple orders, hence the inclusion of the "Items" field in the ORDER table.
- The schema assumes a one-to-many relationship between orders and payments/shipping, as one order can have multiple payments/shipping details.
- Users can have multiple payment methods stored as a string, which may need further normalization for better management.
- The schema doesn't include authentication and authorization mechanisms, assuming they are handled separately.

## 6. Query Implementation.

**Step 3**: Implementation of our identified queries with allotted keyspaces.

In Cassandra, keyspaces are used to group related tables together. They serve a similar purpose to databases in traditional relational database systems. Each keyspace contains one or more tables and defines the replication strategy for the data stored within those tables. When converting an RDBMS schema into Cassandra, it's essential to consider how to organize the tables into keyspaces. Usually one want to group tables that are related and likely to be queried together within the same keyspace. This helps in managing data locality and replication strategies effectively. In Cassandra, the primary key definition implicitly defines the partition key(s) and clustering key(s) for a table. The first component(s) of the primary key define(s) the partition key(s), and any subsequent component(s) define(s) the clustering key(s).

Let's organize the tables into keyspaces based on their relationships and access patterns:

* **Keyspace 1: User Management.**
This keyspace contains tables related to user management.

  - __Tables:__
    - 1. users_by_username.
    - 2. users_by_email.

*  **Keyspace 2: Order Management.**
This keyspace contains tables related to order management.

    - **Tables:**
      - 1. orders_by_user.
      - 2. orders_by_date.
      - 3. shipping_by_order_id.
      - 4. payments_by_user_id.
      - 5. payments_by_order_id.

    - **Materialized Views:**
      - Orders by User ID.

Retrieve orders for a specific user by their user ID. This is a common use case in e-commerce applications where users often want to view their order history or track the status of their orders. Creating a materialized view specifically for orders by user ID allows for efficient retrieval of orders associated with a particular user. By precomputing and storing the order details for each user, queries filtering by user ID can directly access the materialized view, reducing the need for full table scans or secondary indexes.        

* **Keyspace 3: Product Management.**
This keyspace contains tables related to product management.
  - **Tables:**
     - 1. products_by_category.
     - 2. products_by_brand.
     - 3. product_details_by_id.
     - 4. inventory_by_product_id.
* **Keyspace 4: Supplier Management.**
This keyspace contains tables related to supplier management.

   -   **Tables:**
       - 1. supplier_by_id.
