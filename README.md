# üéì Predictive Analytics for Student Retention using PySpark

This repository contains the final project for ISM6562 ‚Äì Big Data for Business, where we developed a predictive model using **PySpark** to classify and forecast **student retention outcomes**. The project uses scalable data processing and machine learning pipelines to support early intervention strategies in higher education.

---

## üìå Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict whether a student will **graduate**, **drop out**, or remain **enrolled** using academic, demographic, and behavioral data.
- **Business Impact**: Equip educational institutions with early warning tools to reduce dropout rates and enhance student support programs.
- **Value Proposition**: Leverage PySpark for scalable ETL and ML operations on large datasets with interpretable model outputs.
